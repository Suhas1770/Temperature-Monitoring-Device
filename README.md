# Temperature-Monitoring-Device
Temperature sensors are vital in many fields. This project uses an ATmega328P microcontroller with a PT100 sensor, powered by a 18650 Li-ion battery for portability. The system can monitor four different temperatures using four sensors, with readings displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD for easy viewing and simplified wiring.
